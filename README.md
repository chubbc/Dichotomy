**Title:** Quantum dichotomies and coherent thermodynamics

**Abstract:** In this talk I will consider the problem of exact and approximate transformations of quantum dichotomies in the asymptotic regime, i.e. when there exists a quantum channel which approximately maps a pair of iid product states to another pair of iid product states. Specifically, I will give not only first-order asymptotic results, but also second-order asymptotic results in *all* error regimes, including small and large deviation error regimes, as well as the zero-error case. I will also discuss how the state interconversion problem in several resource theories, most notably thermodynamics, are in fact examples of this more general problem, and thus the applications of our results to coherent quantum thermodynamics. I will also review the known asymptotic results concerning binary quantum hypothesis testing, which are central in our proofs.
